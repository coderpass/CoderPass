The password manager built for developers, based on JSON.

![Site Demo](appassets/img/site_demo.gif)

Written in Electron with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, no CSS preprocessor: nothing. Which means anyone, even beginners that only know plain HTML and CSS can contribute.

Uses AES and PBKDF2 for encryption and key derivation respectfully, and all passwords are stored locally.
